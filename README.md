# Software Dev Careers Checklist

This is a simple web app that enables you to measure your profeciency in the different software development careers by providing you with a list of the relevant skills you need to master for that career.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

In the directory of the project run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

In the directory of the project run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

## Features

This project features multiple tabs containing the following careers:
- Software Engineer/Developer
- Mobile App Developer
- Web Developer
- Data Scientist
- DevOps Engineer
- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Each career has a list of skills that you need to master for that career. 

Each skill has a drop down menu that allows your to select your current level of profeciency.

Once selected all the skills in that carrer, an overall score will be given at the bottom.

Your entries are saved using **local storage**, meaning that you can come back and continue where you left off.

## Improvements

Here are some improvements I would like to make:

- Add more careers
- Provide more details about each skill
- Provide projects ideas that would enable the user to learn those skills
- Improve UI/UX

## Notes

In its current state, I don't think the project serves as an accuarate test of someone's overall profeciency.
